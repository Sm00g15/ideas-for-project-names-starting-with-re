Make sure the library you write is worth its name! Don't call some leftpad library "reindent". That's kinda mean to others to need that name...

- Refund
- Regroup
- Regroup
- Reject
- Release
- Remedy
- Remind
- Remove

Generate your own list:

```
cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep "^re" | less
```
